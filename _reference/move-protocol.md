# The move protocol

This is the contract every participant's handler must honor, regardless of what harness,
skill, model, or CLI tool drives it. It is deliberately narrow: one primitive move per call,
strictly typed, strictly validated. A participant can be as clever or as reckless as it wants
*inside* this contract — the arena stays renderable either way.

## Why one move at a time, not "here's your sorted array"

Asking an LLM to just emit a fully-sorted array collapses the entire teaching point: you'd see
only the end state, never the *path* — how many comparisons it took, how many swaps, whether it
converged smoothly or thrashed. Comparison-sort algorithms are defined by their sequence of
compares/swaps; visualizing that sequence is what makes harness differences legible on screen,
not just in a benchmark table.

## Round input (bridge → participant, on stdin, one JSON object)

```json
{
  "round": 7,
  "array": [5, 3, 8, 1, 9, 2],
  "history": [
    {"round": 6, "action": "swap", "i": 2, "j": 4, "resultArray": [5, 3, 1, 8, 9, 2]}
  ],
  "budgetRemaining": 43,
  "mode": "solo",
  "you": "algorithm-coached-claude"
}
```

- `array` — the REAL current state. Nothing hidden, nothing pre-sorted for you. In race/partition
  mode this is your own copy/segment — never another participant's.
- `history` — the last up-to-20 moves (not the full trace, to keep the payload bounded — see
  "Bounds" below). Always your own moves only — no mode ever mixes another participant's moves in.
- `budgetRemaining` — how many more rounds this run allows before it's cut off (see "Bounds").
- `mode` — always `"solo"` today. Race and partition are both, from a single handler's own point
  of view, an ordinary solo run against a full array or a segment of one respectively — the
  distinction between arena modes lives entirely in how the bridge orchestrates and streams
  multiple participants, never in what one participant's own round input looks like.
- `you` — your own participant id.

## Your move (stdout, exactly one JSON object, nothing else)

```json
{"action": "compare", "i": 2, "j": 4}
```

```json
{"action": "swap", "i": 2, "j": 4}
```

```json
{"action": "done"}
```

- `compare` — reveals which of `array[i]`/`array[j]` is larger; does not change the array. Free
  of side effects, but still counts as a round (costs budget) — you can't peek for free forever.
- `swap` — exchanges `array[i]` and `array[j]`. This is the only way the array state changes.
- `done` — you believe the array is fully sorted. The bridge checks; if you're right, your run
  ends and your score is recorded. If you're wrong, that's a fault (see below) and you keep going.

No other keys, no prose, no markdown fences. `i`/`j` are 0-based integers, in bounds, and
`i != j`.

## Validation and faults — no participant can ever crash the arena

A malformed response (bad JSON, unknown `action`, out-of-range/equal `i`/`j`, or no output at
all within the timeout) is a **fault**, not a crash:

1. The bridge records the fault against that participant's score.
2. It re-sends the *same* round input, with one added field: `"correction": "<why the last reply was rejected>"`.
3. Up to 2 corrections per round. If still invalid, the bridge skips the round (array
   unchanged, budget still spent) and moves on.

A participant that never emits a single valid move for its entire budget still renders in the
arena — as a flat line and a visibly high fault count. That is itself part of the lesson: a
harness can fail to stay inside the contract just as easily as it can fail to sort well.

## Bounds (why the arena can't be griefed)

- `budgetRemaining` starts at a per-run cap — 200 rounds by default, overridable per request via
  `?budget=N` (clamped to 10–2000) for strategies whose worst case needs more room, e.g. bubble
  sort's O(n²) behavior on an unlucky seed. No participant can stall forever regardless of the
  chosen budget, since 2000 is the hard ceiling.
- Each round's LLM call is wrapped in a timeout (default 30s); a hang is a fault, not a hang.
- `history` sent per round is capped at 20 entries — the payload doesn't grow unbounded over a
  long run.
- `array` length is capped at a fixed max (default 24) — enough to be visually interesting,
  small enough that even a bad strategy finishes within budget.

## Scoring (what the arena measures and shows per participant)

Computed by the bridge from the move trace, never self-reported by the participant:

| Metric | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `comparisons` | count of valid `compare` moves |
| `swaps` | count of valid `swap` moves |
| `faults` | count of rejected/corrected/skipped rounds |
| `roundsUsed` | rounds consumed out of the budget |
| `wallClockMs` | total real time across all LLM calls |
| `inversionsOverTime` | array-length-sized series: inversion count after each move (a standard "how far from sorted" measure — 0 means sorted) |
| `finishedCorrectly` | whether `done` was called AND the array was actually sorted at that point |

`inversionsOverTime` is what actually drives the on-screen animation and the little "signature"
sparkline per participant — no participant ever computes or reports it themselves.

## Retired: relay mode

Earlier versions of this arena had a cooperative "relay" mode (one shared array, participants
taking turns). It's gone — retired 2026-08-11 in favor of race and partition modes below, which
answer the same "how do different harnesses compare" question more directly. `POST /relay` no
longer exists; a request to it now 404s like any other unknown route.

## Solo mode (a single participant, watched)

`POST /run/<participant-id>?len=N&budget=M` — one participant, streamed live, exactly what
`index.html`'s default-selected **Solo run** tab drives (CADS-DEMO-sort#22 found this endpoint was
undocumented here despite being the arena's own default view). Same NDJSON round-event stream
race and partition use (`{"stage":"round",...}` per move, a final `{"stage":"final",...}` summary
with `finishedCorrectly`/`comparisons`/`swaps`/`faults`/`roundsUsed`), just one participant, one
array, no pairing. `len` defaults to 8, clamped to `[2, 24]`; `budget` defaults to 200, per the
usual `?budget=N` override (10-2000).

## Race mode (the direct head-to-head variant)

Same move contract, but instead of one participant owning a full run, every chosen participant
runs an independent `solo` session against its **own copy of the same starting array**,
concurrently. There is no shared state between them — `history` in a race is exactly the same
per-participant shape `solo` mode already sends, never mixed with another participant's moves.
What's new is only the pairing: `POST /race?ids=a,b,c&len=N` starts all of them on an identical
array and streams every participant's round events on one connection, each tagged with `you`,
plus a final ranked summary (finished-correctly first, then fewest `roundsUsed`, then fastest
`wallClockMs`). It answers a direct question: given the exact same array, whose harness actually
gets there first.

## Partition mode (the parallel-segments variant)

Same move contract again, but the array itself is split by **position** into one contiguous
segment per participant — length 100 split 3 ways gives 34/33/33, left segments absorbing the
remainder. Each participant sorts only its own segment: from its own point of view this is
indistinguishable from a normal `solo` run against a smaller array (same `history` shape, same
scoring fields), it just never sees the rest of the whole array.

`POST /partition?ids=a,b,c&len=N` starts the split and streams every participant's round events on
one connection. Each event carries `segmentStart`/`segmentLength` alongside the usual fields, so a
client can translate a participant's own local `i`/`j` into the whole array's global coordinates
(`globalIndex = localIndex + segmentStart`) — useful because, unlike race's genuinely independent
full-length arrays, partition's segments never overlap and can legitimately be drawn into one
shared picture at fixed offsets.

The final summary reports `wholeArraySorted`, and it is usually `false` even when every
segment finished perfectly: splitting by position is not the same as splitting by value range, and
concatenating locally-sorted slices only yields a globally sorted array when each slice already
happened to hold the right value range (real parallel/external sorts need a merge phase afterward,
which this deliberately does not implement — the point here is watching segments sort
concurrently, not shipping a working parallel sort). `perParticipant` reports each segment's own
`finishedCorrectly`/`roundsUsed`/`comparisons`/`swaps`/`faults`, same fields the other modes use.

## Talking to a role over Agent-Fabric — inherited, not reinvented

This protocol only defines the JSON on stdin/stdout. *Getting* that stdin/stdout pair from a
real participant process, over a real Agent-Fabric channel, uses the same mechanism
CADS-flappy-demo and CADS-cookbook-demo already use — `CT_AGENT_SERVICE_HANDLER_CMD` /
`CT_AGENT_SERVICES=text_generation`, documented in CADS-Tunnel's `docs/agent-onboarding.md`. See
[Bring your own participant online]({{ '/tutorials/first-participant/' | relative_url }}) for the
sort-arena-specific walkthrough of that mechanism, live.

## The contract is language-agnostic

Nothing in this protocol is Python. A handler is a program that reads one JSON object from stdin
and writes one JSON object to stdout, so anything that can do those two things qualifies. The
shipped scaffold is Python because an interpreter is almost always already there — not because the
arena cares.

A Java handler, measured against the same checks as the Python baseline on the same array:

```
rounds=28 comparisons=0 swaps=27 faults=0 sorted=True inversions=27
property checks passed: adjacent, optimal-swaps
```

Identical numbers, both property checks passing. And interleaved against the Python baseline, three
runs each on JDK 25:

| | ms per round |
|---|---|
| Java | 38–40 |
| Python | 47–48 |

**Java is not the slower option** — which is worth stating plainly, because an earlier version of
this documentation claimed it cost 211 ms per round against Python's 84 ms. That number was real
but misattributed: the wrapper being measured probed for `java` and `javac` *by executing them* on
every round, so each round paid for three JVM starts instead of one. Removing the probe drops it
from 142 ms to 39 ms — measured, same machine, same minute.

The lesson generalises past this table: **what you measure is the whole invocation, not the
language.** A per-round check that looks free in a script is a process spawn, and process spawns are
what this contract charges for.

Two things do matter when picking a language:

- **Startup dominates.** The handler is invoked once per round, so interpreter or VM startup is paid
  every round while the sorting itself is negligible at these array sizes. Anything with a slow cold
  start will show it here.
- **Keep the dependency count at zero.** The Java handler above is one file, plain JDK, with a
  twenty-line extraction of `array` rather than a JSON library. Adding Maven or a package manager
  buys a build step, and the build step costs more than the parsing did.
