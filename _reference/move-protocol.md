# The move protocol

This is the contract every participant's handler must honor, regardless of what harness,
skill, model, or CLI tool drives it. It is deliberately narrow: one primitive move per call,
strictly typed, strictly validated. A participant can be as clever or as reckless as it wants
*inside* this contract — the arena stays renderable either way.

## Why one move at a time, not "here's your sorted array"

Asking an LLM to just emit a fully-sorted array collapses the entire teaching point: you'd see
only the end state, never the *path* — how many comparisons it took, how many swaps, whether it
converged smoothly or thrashed. Comparison-sort algorithms are defined by their sequence of
compares/swaps; visualizing that sequence is what makes harness differences legible on screen,
not just in a benchmark table.

## Round input (bridge → participant, on stdin, one JSON object)

```json
{
  "round": 7,
  "array": [5, 3, 8, 1, 9, 2],
  "history": [
    {"round": 6, "action": "swap", "i": 2, "j": 4, "resultArray": [5, 3, 1, 8, 9, 2]}
  ],
  "budgetRemaining": 43,
  "mode": "solo",
  "you": "algorithm-coached-claude"
}
```

- `array` — the REAL current state. Nothing hidden, nothing pre-sorted for you.
- `history` — the last up-to-20 moves (not the full trace, to keep the payload bounded — see
  "Bounds" below). In `relay` mode this includes moves made by *other* participants.
- `budgetRemaining` — how many more rounds this run allows before it's cut off (see "Bounds").
- `mode` — `"solo"` (you own the whole array end to end) or `"relay"` (you get one move per
  tick, in rotation with every other currently-online participant, on a shared array).
- `you` — your own participant id, so in `relay` mode you can tell your moves apart in `history`.

## Your move (stdout, exactly one JSON object, nothing else)

```json
{"action": "compare", "i": 2, "j": 4}
```

```json
{"action": "swap", "i": 2, "j": 4}
```

```json
{"action": "done"}
```

- `compare` — reveals which of `array[i]`/`array[j]` is larger; does not change the array. Free
  of side effects, but still counts as a round (costs budget) — you can't peek for free forever.
- `swap` — exchanges `array[i]` and `array[j]`. This is the only way the array state changes.
- `done` — you believe the array is fully sorted. The bridge checks; if you're right, your run
  ends and your score is recorded. If you're wrong, that's a fault (see below) and you keep going.

No other keys, no prose, no markdown fences. `i`/`j` are 0-based integers, in bounds, and
`i != j`.

## Validation and faults — no participant can ever crash the arena

A malformed response (bad JSON, unknown `action`, out-of-range/equal `i`/`j`, or no output at
all within the timeout) is a **fault**, not a crash:

1. The bridge records the fault against that participant's score.
2. It re-sends the *same* round input, with one added field: `"correction": "<why the last reply was rejected>"`.
3. Up to 2 corrections per round. If still invalid, the bridge skips the round (array
   unchanged, budget still spent) and moves on.

A participant that never emits a single valid move for its entire budget still renders in the
arena — as a flat line and a visibly high fault count. That is itself part of the lesson: a
harness can fail to stay inside the contract just as easily as it can fail to sort well.

## Bounds (why the arena can't be griefed)

- `budgetRemaining` starts at a fixed per-run cap (default 200 rounds) — no participant can
  stall forever.
- Each round's LLM call is wrapped in a timeout (default 30s); a hang is a fault, not a hang.
- `history` sent per round is capped at 20 entries — the payload doesn't grow unbounded over a
  long run.
- `array` length is capped at a fixed max (default 24) — enough to be visually interesting,
  small enough that even a bad strategy finishes within budget.

## Scoring (what the arena measures and shows per participant)

Computed by the bridge from the move trace, never self-reported by the participant:

| Metric | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `comparisons` | count of valid `compare` moves |
| `swaps` | count of valid `swap` moves |
| `faults` | count of rejected/corrected/skipped rounds |
| `roundsUsed` | rounds consumed out of the budget |
| `wallClockMs` | total real time across all LLM calls |
| `inversionsOverTime` | array-length-sized series: inversion count after each move (a standard "how far from sorted" measure — 0 means sorted) |
| `finishedCorrectly` | whether `done` was called AND the array was actually sorted at that point |

`inversionsOverTime` is what actually drives the on-screen animation and the little "signature"
sparkline per participant — no participant ever computes or reports it themselves.

## Relay mode (the cooperative variant)

Same array, same move contract, but instead of one participant owning a full run, every
currently-online participant gets exactly one move per tick, in rotation. `history` shows the
whole team's moves so far, including who made them. The point isn't just "who sorts best solo" —
it's watching a chaotic harness's move get quietly cleaned up by a methodical one two ticks
later, or two mismatched strategies repeatedly undo each other. Same scoring table, computed
per participant across the shared trace.

## Talking to a role over Agent-Fabric — inherited, not reinvented

This protocol only defines the JSON on stdin/stdout. *Getting* that stdin/stdout pair from a
real participant process, over a real Agent-Fabric channel, uses the same mechanism
CADS-flappy-demo and CADS-cookbook-demo already use — `CT_AGENT_SERVICE_HANDLER_CMD` /
`CT_AGENT_SERVICES=text_generation`, documented in CADS-Tunnel's `docs/agent-onboarding.md`. See
[Bring your own participant online]({{ '/tutorials/first-participant/' | relative_url }}) for the
sort-arena-specific walkthrough of that mechanism, live.
